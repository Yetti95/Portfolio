# Portfolio
Senior Year Portfolio. Containing 5 artifacts reflecting my work at Westminster College.

## Senior project: VR Building Design
[Link to senior project](https://github.com/Yetti95/Alpha-VR-Blueprints)

In my line of work, we use three-dimensional (3D) models and measurement data taken from a job site, like a stock pile or piece of land. We take these and combine them into a set of points in a 3D coordinate system, called a point cloud, to accurately survey large areas in record-breaking time. This is a very efficient way of working. The issue I found in my work is the lack of vision and communication in the planning step of building. The planning step is where my project comes in. The project is a Virtual Reality (VR) structure designer. Current design software doesnâ€™t give a sense of scale, but in VR, the terrain and environment can be scaled to life-size. This will give a more accurate sense of scale and help with portraying the design envisioned.

## Artifact 1: Elm Platforming Game

In Programming Languages, we focused on different computer languages to expand out understanding of how the most common languages operater. We looked at expr, scala, and elm mainly. These are object oriented languages just like Java and Python. In our final project of the course we were tasked with using elm in making a game. Elm is a computer language built to write websites and web application. It is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Up to this point I had no previous knowledge of the language. Me and my partner choose to do a platforming game. This project helped me bolster my Software Design and problem solving skills. We only had two weeks to write the program and learn how the language worked. This was one of the more challenging assignments I have had due to the new technologies and the time restrictions. I feel this shows my abilities to code under pressure.

Learning Goal(s):
* To understand the concepts and techniques of <del>object oriented</del> software design.
* To develop effective problem solving skills.



## Artifact 2: Choose Your Polotics

In Software engineering we worked in a group of four on a project of our choice for the full semester. Our project was a website that gave the user articles for both local and national news from both left and right perspectives. It was mainly focused on local polotics because we felt that the information about local issues was harder to find in Utah. We implemented this using Pythons's Django framework. The website would go and scrape articles from other websites. Based on the website the article came from we weighted it and placed it in a database. It was then displayed using html and bootstrap in a easy to read format. This project helped me expand my problem-selving skills and Software Develpment skills. The hardest obsticle with our website was group participation but we ultimately over came that.

Learning Goal(s):
* To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting
* To develop effective problem solving skills.
* TO understand the concepts and techniques of <del>object oriented</del> software design.



## Artifact 3: WebServer

In our Networks class, we made a web server taht could host basic web pages, images, and other data that could be accessed from another device. This server took an XML configuration file that would allow any user to change the source of the data to their use case. This server also created a log file, if one was not defined in the configuration, and log all request headers that the server recieved. This assignment helped me understand how a sever access data and how http headers work. Overall it elaborated on my knowledge of computer networks and how computers interact with each other and the user.

Learning Goal(s):
* To attain a system level understanding of the computer.
* To develop effective problem solving skills.



## Artifact 4: Chatroom

For our final project in the Networks class we were tasked with creating our own protocal and implementing it. Designing the protocol was in a group of ten, but implenting it was left to groups of two. In my group of two we decided to use Python due to its built in library for json, the main component of our protocol. In Python we had to design a server and client that would not only work with each other but also with any other groups that used our protocol. The protocol was made much harder than it needed to be. After getting the server up and running we had to design the multithreaded client applicaiton with a GUI. That was the hardest part. I had never done GUI design without the help of an IDE before. Ultimately this assignment helped me increase my understanding of how computer networks work and how we allow technologies to interact with a network. 

Learning Goal(s):
* To attain a system level understanding of the computer.
* To acquire significant experience working both individually and in a group setting.



## Artifact 5: Expr.scala
[Link to project](https://github.com/Yetti95/Portfolio/blob/master/expr.scala)

In Programming Languages, we focused on different computer languages to expand out understanding of how the most common languages operater. We looked at expr, scala, and elm mainly. These are object oriented languages just like Java and Python. The main project of the course was using scala to write an interpater for expr. This took most of the semester. We had very little guidance until after a due date. I found this application to be very difficult due to not only learning two new languages at once but also have to convert one to the other. In the end we were able to run a scala application that allowed us to run a small set of the expr command list. This project helped me devlope my Software Design and problem solving skills.


In our final project of the course we were tasked with using elm in making a game. Elm is a computer language built to write websites and web application. It is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Up to this point I had no previous knowledge of the language. Me and my partner choose to do a platforming game. This project helped me bolster my Software Design and problem solving skills. We only had two weeks to write the program and learn how the language worked. This was one of the more challenging assignments I have had due to the new technologies and the time restrictions. I feel this shows my abilities to code under pressure.

* To understand the concepts and techniques of <del>object oriented</del> software design.
* To develop effective problem solving skills.
